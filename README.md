This is a repository of the course work dedicated to the topic "Embedding in the Study of Idioms".

The folder [collection](https://github.com/katearb/idioms/tree/master/collection) contains:
 * .dsl dictionaries (Fedorov, Fedosov, Kveselevich, Myurrey, Volkova)
 * .json files. Five of them correspond to the parsed .dsl files, the sixth contains all of them together.
 * .py files: five parsers for each dictionary, one for creating all_idioms.json and some support files.
 
 The folder [statistics](https://github.com/katearb/idioms/tree/master/statistics) contains jupyter notebooks, where some analysis of the idioms is presented.
